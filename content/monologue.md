[0x22](/) is at the same time the name and the object-system of my artistic movements. It's the system of those metaphors, images and feelings that resulted in the same art - an art being personal from its impersonality - in my poetry and in the music I write, nay even in the images in my dreams and trips. If I would have to choose, I would say poetry is at the center of all my thinking, since I work like a poet even while making music, and all the songs I compose are just as much poems or verses as the texts I write. This site tries to bring this artist closer to my other self, the one that is bound to the space of logic. An uncomfortably personal space, spreading across the languages I use; the monolith of my artistic self on the internet, ["In place of an ars poetica"](https://mek.oszk.hu/01000/01016/01016.htm#h2_9).

After my early writings, the last few years were spent with a silent period of work, in which the creations shaped each other and said system, just like the tide shapes a river delta resting in the sunset. The poems are read only by a few, the sounds are listened to only by a few, but day after day they go through a slow, calm and precise workflow.

"Where distances collapse into muteness"

Landscapes, mountains, a sea, a river delta and light. Time, the horizon of the moment and the gravity of the past. The yesterdays. Seeing her through noise and gloom.

This chapter began when I stopped writing about the past and started staring at spaces that fall outside of time, where yesterday happens again and again in the now. The thoughts, themes and addressees of the poems got washed together, almost like all I write would be the permutation of a single moment. In the music I hear the winter nights of the city and the noisy, gray breathing of solitude, but the very same images from my poetry also appear from time to time. This landscape is psychedelic, a bit impressionist and so personal that sometimes I feel like I'm binding my soul to a rock next to Prometheus.

I trust my present and hope that in a few years this will end up in a book of poetry, in an album.

zaj / noise

átlátsz a töredékek vánszorgó, időtlen zaján,
feléd mutató vektorokon a sötét
és elképzelhetetlen éjféli tájban,
az ismeretlen, magánnyá fakult nappalok egén.

mindezen túl, egy tétova érintésnyire,
valaki áll a köd peremén,
nem néz feléd és nem néz semerre,
nem miattad áll ott, csak belóg a múlt kontúrjén túlra,
úgy áll, mintha éppen most vetkőzte volna le szenvedéseit.

onnan nézve töredék vagy, 
fájdalomtól súlytalan seb a hangtalan esőben,
maszatos neonfény egy szexmozi előtt a járdán,
a kitömött gyönyörben táguló pillanattöredék,
a homály és a képzelet az emlékeimben,
minden, ami a szoba bizonytalanságában maradt,
utolsó szavad szilánkokra tört árnyéka a padlón,
bőrömön lágyan sóhajtó csendje vágyaid zakatolásának,
a csend, ez az egy,
az olthatatlan és mindörökkévaló csend.

egyszer majd elengedem a fényévek alatt
versekbe rongyolt változások emlékét.

állok félelmet izzadó terekben,
ott vagyok a látóhatár vibráló egyenesén
és magamra veszem mindazt a szenvedést,
amit az emlékedben ártatlan én levetkőzött.

Psychedelia

After my first touches with psychedelic music, I started to wonder how would psychedelic literature feel like. Now, years later, as an enormous surprise it struck me that I think I've found an answer to that in my very own poetry. Psychedelic poetry, but in the sense of how white noise and minimalism are psychedelic. In this language you have to go further, you have to find answers for yourself and sometimes looking at the answer you have to find the question it's replying to.

The object-system

At first sight, the system I work in might appear as a system of symbols, however the re- and reappearing images and metaphors don't hide explicit meanings and they don't originate from some collective consciousness. In this system the very same darkness, the very same light, the very same river delta, the very same sea and seashore appear every single time. Single, specific objects that were formed some time in the past without my awareness.
